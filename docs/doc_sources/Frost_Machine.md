# `FrostMachine` Reactor

The `FrostMachine` reactor is a composite component that combines the functionalities of `FrostDataModel` and `FrostReactor`. It is designed to serve as a base for creating "machine" actors in the Frost ecosystemâ€”components that represent the physical or logical parts of a cyber-physical system, complete with their own state (data model) and communication capabilities.

### Core Functionalities

- **Inheritance**: It inherits from both `FrostDataModel` and `FrostReactor`, giving it the combined capabilities of both. This means it can manage a data model, connect to the `FrostBus`, and handle messages according to the Frost protocol.
- **Update Step**: It introduces an `update_step` parameter, which can be used to define a time step for periodic updates within the machine. This is useful for simulations or for components that need to perform actions at regular intervals.

### What You Can Do with a `FrostMachine`

A `FrostMachine` is the primary building block for creating digital twins or simulated components in the Frost ecosystem. By extending this reactor, you can:

-   **Model System Components**: Represent any physical or logical part of your system, such as a machine, sensor, or software service. The component's state is defined in its data model, including parameters, sensor readings, and operational status.

-   **Implement Dynamic Behavior**: Use timers and reactions to simulate the component's behavior over time. This allows you to model time-based processes, state transitions, and the core logic of the component's operation.

-   **Expose behavior**: Expose methods through the data model that other components can invoke. By implementing these methods as callbacks, you create a clear and well-defined interface for your machine, enabling other parts of the system to interact with it.

-   **Orchestrate Complex Interactions**: A `FrostMachine` can act as a client to other components. It can send messages to read or write variables in other data models or invoke their methods, allowing for complex, system-level workflows and interactions.

-   **React to External Events**: Handle incoming messages to react to commands or data from other parts of the system. This allows a `FrostMachine` to be controlled or influenced by external actors or other machines, making it a dynamic participant in the overall system.
